        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By creating an account, connecting a third-party platform (including but not

            youtubeNob is a self-hosted content-automation tool that helps users generate,

            basis.

            You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your
